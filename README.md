# Introduction

Hi, my name is *Alejandro G.P*, and I'm a software developer with a passion for elegant algorithmic solutions. Here's a bit more about me:

-I have experience developing 3D, 2D, and VR games for mobile and desktop platforms, using tools like Unity and I can find my way mainly around **Python, Java, C#, JavaScript**

-I'm currently focused on API integration with **LLM's**, specifically GPT-4, and developing applications that leverage this tool to solve interesting problems.

-In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and experimenting with them and how they may be expanded upon

-You can find examples of my work on my GitHub page, and feel free to contact me at **alejandrogarcia2423@hotmail.com** with any questions or inquiries.
